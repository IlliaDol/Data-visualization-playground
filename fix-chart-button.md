# Fix for "Create Chart" Button Issue

## Problem
The "Create Chart" button was not working properly due to:
1. Lack of proper validation and error handling
2. No user guidance when fields are not selected
3. No feedback when no data is loaded

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in `handleCreateChart`
- Added validation for required fields (X and Y axis)
- Added user-friendly error messages in Ukrainian
- Added try-catch block for better error handling
- Added success confirmation message

### 2. Improved Button UI
- Dynamic button text that shows what's missing
- Tooltip with helpful information
- Visual feedback when fields are not selected

### 3. Added User Guidance
- Helpful message when no data is loaded
- Step-by-step instructions when fields are not selected
- Clear indication of what needs to be done

### 4. Created Test Page
- Added `/test` page with sample data for testing
- Demonstrates the complete workflow
- Shows created charts in real-time

## How to Test

### Option 1: Use the Test Page
1. Navigate to `/test` in your browser
2. Click "Load Sample Data for Testing"
3. Select fields for X and Y axis
4. Click "Create Chart" button
5. Verify the chart is created successfully

### Option 2: Use Main Page
1. Navigate to the main page `/`
2. Upload a data file (CSV, Excel, JSON, etc.)
3. Select fields for X and Y axis
4. Click "Create Chart" button
5. Verify the chart is created successfully

## Commands to Run

```bash
# Build the project to check for errors
npm run build

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open browser and navigate to:
# http://localhost:3000/test (for testing)
# http://localhost:3000 (for main functionality)
```

## Expected Behavior

1. **When no data is loaded**: Shows helpful message to upload data
2. **When fields are not selected**: Shows step-by-step instructions
3. **When Create Chart is clicked**: 
   - Validates required fields
   - Shows error message if validation fails
   - Creates chart and shows success message if validation passes
4. **Button text changes**: Shows what's missing (X field, Y field, or "Create Chart")

## Files Modified

- `components/ChartBuilder.tsx` - Enhanced error handling and UI improvements
- `app/test/page.tsx` - Created test page for debugging

## Troubleshooting

If the button still doesn't work:

1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify that data is properly loaded (check `dataProfile` state)
3. Ensure fields are selected in the dropdowns
4. Check if the `onChartCreated` callback is properly passed from parent component

## Sample Data for Testing

You can use the sample CSV file in `test-data/sample.csv`:
```csv
name,age,city,salary
John,25,New York,50000
Alice,30,Los Angeles,60000
Bob,35,Chicago,55000
Eve,28,Boston,52000
David,32,Seattle,58000
```
